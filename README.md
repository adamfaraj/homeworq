# HomeWorq

Homeowners often neglect maintenance, leading to costly repairs; HomeWorq is a home management platform app that schedules upkeep tasks, sends reminders, and connects users with service professionals as needed.

# Features

## Customized Maintenance Schedule: 

The user inputs basic info about their home (square footage, type of heating/cooling systems, number of appliances, whether they have a yard, etc.). The app generates a tailored maintenance calendar. For instance, it reminds you to service your HVAC every spring and fall, clean gutters every autumn, test smoke detectors every 6 months, flush the water heater annually, change fridge water filter every 6 months, etc. These reminders would come with how-to guides or links for each task (e.g., “It’s April, time to check your AC – here’s how to clean the condenser unit”).

## Task Tracking and Logs:

As tasks are completed, you mark them done, building a maintenance log. This is useful for personal tracking and even for when you sell the home (proving you kept things maintained). If you skip or delay a task, the app might nudge you or adjust frequency.

## Issue & Inventory Management:

A place to note any issues noticed around the house (“small crack in ceiling paint in bedroom”) with photos – like a to-do list for repairs needed. The app could also keep an inventory of home assets (appliances, roof, etc.), including installation dates or last replacement dates. For example, know that the roof is 10 years old, the app might suggest “Roof inspection” around year 12 or “budget for replacement in 3-5 years”.

## Budgeting and Cost Insights:

The app can help budget for home maintenance. It might estimate you should set aside, say, 1% of home value per year for upkeep (a common rule of thumb) and track your actual spend. It can alert if a certain category is trending high. Over time it could even provide estimates: “Cleaning gutters typically costs $100 if hiring out” or “DIY cost: $0”.

## Professional Assistance Integration:

When a task or issue is beyond DIY, the app can connect you to local vetted professionals. For instance, if you get a reminder to service HVAC, you have the option to click “Find a pro” and see a list of HVAC service companies (through an integration with a service marketplace). Similarly, if the app detects (or you input) a problem like “roof leak”, it can suggest contacting a roofer and facilitate getting quotes. This makes the app not just a reminder tool but a concierge for home services. Users can also send messages to local vetted professionals.
